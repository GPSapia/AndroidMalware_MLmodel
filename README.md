# AndroidMalware_MLmodel

The model in this repository is a classification model that predicts whether an Android application is a benign application or is a malware. An Android application is characterized by many features (215), that can be classified as follows:

* API that the application calls
* Android permissions the application requests
* The intents the application sends (Intents in Android are used for IPC purposes)
* The system commands the application uses

The output is binary: benign or malware.

The training set included real Android applications, both benign and malware. The trained model has an accuracy of around 98%. However, it is important to stress its most important limitation:

* The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2012. This means that some of the features that are used to characterize the applications used to train the model may be outdated, while newer features are most probably missing (e.g. new API added in subsequent versions of Android).

For this reason, this model has probably a lower accuracy for more recent Android applications.

**Short technical description**: given the characteristics of the classification problem, I decided to implement a Support Vector Machine model. What this type of model does is to place an hyperplane between the two classes of samples (in this case, benign or malware). This kind of model can also deal with non-linear relationships between inputs and output by using the so-called kernel trick: what we do is to add a dimension to the vector space where our features live so that we can better separate benign samples from malware samples. To do so, we use a kernel function (in the code, this is represented by the 'kernel' value in the `param_grid` variable, which is used for grid search over the hyperparameter space; notice, indeed, that we can use many different kernel functions).
