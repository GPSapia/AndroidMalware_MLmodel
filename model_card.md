# Model Card

The model analyzed in this model card is able to detect whether an Android application is benign or is a malware. An input to this model is an Android application characterized by many features (See section *Model description* for more information), while the output is binary: the application is benign or is a malware.

## Model Description

**Input:** each input represents an Android application described by many features: the methods it calls, the permissions it uses, the Intents it sends, the system commands it uses. 

**Output:** The output is binary: 1 it the application is a malware, 0 if it is a benign application.

**Model Architecture:** Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel used for kernel trick.

## Performance

The model achieved around 98% accuracy on the test set. This means that the model correctly classified the Android applications in the test set as either benign or malware 98% of the times. The following confusion matrix summarizes the results:

## Limitations

The main limitation of the model is related to the dataset on which it was trained on: indeed, it has been trained on a dataset of Android applications gathered between 2010 and 2012. This means that some feature may be outdated, while some other features may not be present at all (i.e. new features added in more recent Android version).
