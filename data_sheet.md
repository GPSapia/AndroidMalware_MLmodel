## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 

  The dataset has originally been used to develop and evaluate multilevel classifier fusion approach for Android malware detection, which is described at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8245867.

- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?

  The dataset was created by the authors of the abovementioned research paper, which are members of IEEE. To create this dataset, they extracted features from the DREBIN dataset, from the University of Göttingen, Germany. The latter dataset contains 5,560 applications from 179 different malware families.


## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?

  The instances of this dataset represent Android applications. Each of them is characterized by different elements such as the API that the application calls, the Android permission that the application requests, the Intents it sends, the system commands it uses. The applications can be benign or malware.

- How many instances of each type are there?

  There are 15,036 applications (5,560 malware apps from Drebin project and 9,476 benign apps).

- Is there any missing data?

  There were just 5 applications having a missing column. Apart from these, the dataset is complete.

- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?

  No.

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired?

  The data was acquired by statically analyzing Android applications. In particular, a Python tool was used to extract permissions and intents from the application manifest file after decompiling with AXMLprinter2 (a library for decompiling Android manifest file); moreover, API calls were extracted through reverse engineering the .dex files by means of the Baksmali disassembler. Finally, the static analyzer also searches for dangerous Linux commands from the application files and checks for the presence of embedded .dex, .jar, .so, and .exe files within the application.

- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy?

  The data is not a sample of a larger subset.

- Over what time frame was the data collected?

  The DREBIN dataset was collected  in the period of August 2010 to October 2012. From this dataset, the authors of the dataset used for this model extracted features to create their own dataset. The latter was first made public in 2018.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.

  No.

- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 

## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for?

  Unknown to the author of this data sheet.

- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?

  Because the dataset has been obtained by extracting features from Android applications collected between 2010 and 2012, there is a possibility that some of the features used to characterize the applications are outdated. Therefore, before using this dataset for modern Android malware detection, it is suggested to check whether any feature is outdated (e.g. deprecated API).

- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.

  If the goal is to detect modern Android malware, it is suggested to make sure that the features used in this dataset are not outdated and if modern applications use functionalities that are missing from this dataset. If these precautions are not taken, the resulting model may underperform in detecting modern malware.

## Distribution
